# lottery
This is a lottery system (HTML+JS+CSS+Jquery) that can be used for live streaming or an in-house sweepstakes. The code background color is in the 21 columns of the index.css. The name is changed to data in the JS folder. It's just a simple lottery system, and there's no other purpose, you can add it yourself if you have an idea.
